# Hitme-ios-app
This is a simple target game where the goal is to drag the slider as close as possible to the target number given on screen and click "Hit me!"

# Scoring
- If you hit the target directly +10 is added to your score
- If you're off by 1, +9 is added
- If you're off by 2, +8 is added
- And so on...If you are more than 10 off from the target in either direction, nothing will be added to your score

# Development:
